## Description

## Installation

Currently, only the manual installation is available.

### Manual

Hmmm, don't install this.  Check back here later.  I am working on it...

Honestly, if you really need these instructions, then perhaps installing this plugin may not be the right thing for you..

2.  'cd' to your plugin directory.
3.  Clone this repository.
4.  Go to your WordPress Dashboard->Plugins screen and activate the plugin.
5.  Either click on the Settings link, or go to dashboard->setting->Privacy My Way, to edit and save the options.
6.  Open an issue on github about what went wrong.

#### FTP

1.  Clone the repository to your computer
2.  FTP to your site.
3.  Using your FTP client copy the repository into your server's WordPress plugin directory.  You can delete the .git folder on the server, if you need the space...
4.  Go to your WordPress Dashboard->Plugins screen and activate the plugin.
5.  Either click on the Settings link, or go to Dashboard->Settings->Privacy My Way, to edit and save the options.
6.  Open an issue on github about what went wrong.

### Warning

This is beta code.  Use at your own risk.  I do not expect it to break your site, but if it does, then you get to keep the pieces.  Please do not email them to me.
