Currently, only the manual installation is available.

### Manual

Hmmm, don't install this.  Check back here later.  I am working on it...

1.  SSH onto your site.
2.  cd to your plugin directory.
3.  clone this repository with 'git clone git@github.com:RichardCoffee/privacy-my-way.git'.
4.  Go to your WordPress dashboard and activate the plugin.
5.  go to dashboard->setting->Privacy My Way to edit and save the options.

### Warning

This is alpha code.  Use at your own risk.  I would not expect it to break your site, but if it does, then it's all on you.
